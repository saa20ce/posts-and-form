# posts-and-form

This simple app you can view some posts and send your info via feedback form

I used Symfony, MySQL

To start app you need to import ".sql" file or my database dump file "posts_and_form.sql"

Use ".env" file to route database connection, name and password, on line 28 "DATABASE_URL"
